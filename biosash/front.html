                    concentrate juice or
                    capsule - providing vitamins & minerals required by the human body every single day.

                    Sea buck thorn berry - Latin name Hippophae rhamnoides - Clutches solid rock around raging rivers
                    fed
                    from ancient glaciers, at elevations as high as 14,000 feet. This thorny plant's fruit is a bright
                    orange berry that glows bright - almost fluorescent in this nearly colorless world- and grows wild
                    in
                    the Himalayas.

                    Genghis Khan powered his army and their horses on sea Buckthorn for stamina and recovery from
                    combat.
                    The botanical name, Hippophae L. is derived from the Greek word "hippo," meaning horse. Sea
                    Buckthorn
                    was used to strengthen ancient Greek horses and restore their coats to a brilliant luster. And women
                    throughout the ages have used sea Buckthorn to protect them from the ravages of the sun and the
                    elements. Founded on tradition and now based on extensive scientific research, sea Buckthorn is one
                    of
                    the biggest functional whole food rediscoveries of the 21st century.

                    Written in the eighth century AD, the classic Tibetan medical book, Sibu Yidian, devotes thirty
                    chapters
                    to the medicinal and nutritional uses of Sea Buckthorn. And, perhaps most importantly, Sibu Yidian
                    says
                    that Sea Buckthorn atonifies yin and strengthens yang. In modern Western language, that means it
                    creates
                    balance. Sea Buckthorn - written about 1300 years ago - is now perhaps the most comprehensively
                    researched berry in the world.

                    Other cultures have also found balance from Sea Buckthorn. In India, it is an important part of
                    traditional Ayurveda. It is essential in the Chinese Pharmacopiea. In Mongolia, it has long been
                    seen as
                    a source for indefatigable life energy which is why, it is said, Genghis Khan and his armies drank
                    the
                    juice of the Sea Buckthorn. Modern analysis of the Sea Buckthorn berry reveals an incredible array
                    of
                    nutritive and restorative properties.

                    We now bring you this mind boggling revolutionary range of premium Sea Buckthorn products which are
                    derived from this wonder berry processed by us with modern techniques from our exclusive sources.

                    Traditionally Sea Buckthorn was used for improved immune health and general well being including
                    joint
                    support, wrinkles, dry and damaged skin, exzcema and rosacea symptoms and sustained energy levels
